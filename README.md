# üß† OmniFocus AI Triage Assistant

A smart, semi-automated OmniFocus inbox triage system that uses OpenAI to intelligently categorize tasks, integrated with Alfred for fast, keyboard-driven access.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Categorization**: Automatically sorts tasks in the OmniFocus Inbox into appropriate projects based on task title and description using OpenAI.
- **Manual Review Mode**: Lets you approve or override AI-suggested projects before applying them.
- **YouTube Enrichment**: Detects YouTube-only tasks, fetches the video title & description, and replaces the task note with that info before moving to project.
- **"Unknown" Bucket**: Catches anything the AI can't confidently categorize so nothing falls through the cracks.
- **macOS Keychain Integration**: Securely stores and retrieves your OpenAI API key.
- **Alfred Workflow**: Instantly launch the plugin via Alfred using a hotkey or keyword, complete with visual feedback.
- **OmniFocus-Aware**: Automatically opens OmniFocus if it isn't running, so the plugin can do its job.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS
- OmniFocus 3
- Alfred (optional, for keyboard-driven access)
- OpenRouter API key

#### Obtaining an OpenRouter API Key

1. Visit [OpenRouter's website](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Login" if you already have an account
3. Once logged in, navigate to your [API Keys page](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
4. Click "Create Key" to generate a new API key
5. Copy the generated key and store it securely
6. Use this key when configuring the plugin

The OpenRouter API key is required for the AI-powered categorization feature to work. The key is stored securely in your macOS Keychain and is only used for making API calls to OpenRouter's service.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Double-click the `.omnifocusjs` bundle to install
3. Configure your OpenAI API key in the plugin settings

### Plugin Settings

The plugin settings are accessed through a form that appears when you run the plugin. To configure the plugin:

1. Run the plugin using one of the methods described in the Weekly Review Workflow section
2. A settings form will appear where you can configure. You can get this on other runs by ctrl clicking:
   - **Unknown Tag Name**: The name for the "Unknown" bucket where unclassified tasks go
   - **Maximum Tasks**: How many tasks to process in one batch
   - **OpenRouter Model**: The AI model to use for classification
   - **Additional Context**: Custom instructions or context for the AI to consider when categorizing tasks
   - **API Key**: Your OpenRouter API key for accessing the AI service

#### Using Additional Context

The Additional Context field allows you to provide extra information to guide the AI in categorizing your tasks. This can be particularly useful for:

- **Personal Preferences**: "I prefer to keep work and personal tasks separate"
- **Project Organization**: "Programming tasks should go into technical projects"
- **Task Patterns**: "Tasks starting with 'Watch:' are usually educational content"
- **Custom Rules**: "Always put shopping-related tasks in the 'Shopping' project"

Example contexts:
```
I work as a software developer and prefer to organize my tasks by programming language. Put Python tasks in 'Python Projects' and JavaScript tasks in 'JS Projects'.
```
```
I'm a content creator. Tasks about video editing should go to 'Content Production' and research tasks to 'Content Research'.
```

The settings are automatically saved and will persist between plugin runs.

## üîÑ Weekly Review Workflow

The plugin is designed to be part of your weekly review process. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: OmniFocus Repeating Task

1. Create a New Task
	‚Ä¢	Title: Run weekly inbox triage
	‚Ä¢	Project: Anywhere you want (e.g., a "Weekly Review" project)
	‚Ä¢	Defer Date: Set it to the next triage day (e.g., next Monday)
	‚Ä¢	Repeat: Every 1 week

2. Attach a Plugin URL

OmniFocus plugins can be run via a custom URL scheme. Use this format:

omnifocus://localhost/plug-in-action?name=tagSortInbox&plugIn=InboxSortViaAI.omnifocusjs

Replace InboxSortViaAI.omnifocusjs with the name of your plugin bundle if you renamed it.

	‚Ä¢	Paste this URL into the Note field of the task.

3. Click the Link When It's Time

Each week when the task comes due:
	‚Ä¢	Open the task
	‚Ä¢	Click the link
	‚Ä¢	The plugin runs and sorts your inbox using OpenRouter + rules + YouTube enrichment

‚∏ª

üöÄ Pro Tip (macOS only)

If you use an automation tool like Keyboard Maestro, Shortcuts, or Raycast, you can bind that plugin URL to a hotkey or automation to launch it even faster.

Let me know if you'd like to integrate with a launcher like that!Absolutely, yes! You can bind the OmniFocus plugin to a custom Alfred workflow, so you can trigger your weekly inbox triage with a simple keyword or hotkey.

Here's how to do it:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Bind OmniFocus Plugin to Alfred

1. Create a New Alfred Workflow
	‚Ä¢	Open Alfred Preferences
	‚Ä¢	Go to Workflows
	‚Ä¢	Click + (bottom left) ‚Üí Blank Workflow
	‚Ä¢	Name it something like OmniFocus Triage
	‚Ä¢	Add a description if you like (e.g., "Runs OpenRouter-powered tag triage for OmniFocus Inbox")

‚∏ª

2. Add a Trigger

Choose one of the following:
	‚Ä¢	Keyword: e.g., triage
	‚Ä¢	Hotkey: Optional, if you want to trigger with a key combo

Right-click in the workflow canvas and choose:
	‚Ä¢	Triggers ‚Üí Keyword or Triggers ‚Üí Hotkey

Set:
	‚Ä¢	Keyword: triage
	‚Ä¢	Title: Run OmniFocus Triage
	‚Ä¢	Subtitle: Something like Sort Inbox Tasks by Tags using AI
	‚Ä¢	Argument: Leave unchecked

‚∏ª

3. Add a "Run Script" Action
	‚Ä¢	Right-click ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Run Script
	‚Ä¢	Language: /bin/bash
	‚Ä¢	Script:

open "omnifocus://localhost/plug-in-action?name=tagSortInbox&plugIn=InboxSortViaAI.omnifocusjs"

Update the plugIn parameter if you renamed your plugin.

Connect the Keyword/Hotkey node to the Run Script node.

‚∏ª

4. Test It
	‚Ä¢	Press your keyword (triage) in Alfred
	‚Ä¢	Hit Enter
	‚Ä¢	OmniFocus should launch and run the plugin

‚∏ª

üîí Pro Tip

If you're using Alfred Powerpack, you can even show task status or AppleScript-driven feedback inside Alfred. Want to do that? I can give you a version that:
	‚Ä¢	Verifies OmniFocus is open
	‚Ä¢	Displays a notification or Alfred dialog once triage is complete

Just say the word!Awesome ‚Äî here's how to level up your Alfred workflow to:
	1.	‚úÖ Check that OmniFocus is running
	2.	üöÄ Open your plugin
	3.	üßæ Show a notification or Alfred dialog when done

‚∏ª

üîß Enhanced Alfred Workflow Script

Step-by-step for the Run Script node:

1. Use /usr/bin/osascript for AppleScript

Set the Language to /usr/bin/osascript and paste this script:

-- Check if OmniFocus is running
tell application "System Events"
	if not (exists process "OmniFocus") then
		display dialog "Opening OmniFocus‚Ä¶" buttons {"OK"} giving up after 1
		tell application "OmniFocus" to activate
		delay 2
	end if
end tell

-- Open the plugin via URL
do shell script "open 'omnifocus://localhost/plug-in-action?name=tagSortInbox&plugIn=InboxSortViaAI.omnifocusjs'"

-- Optional: Notify user
display notification "AI Inbox triage started in OmniFocus." with title "Triage Plugin"



‚∏ª

üí° Optional: Add Feedback in Alfred

Want a visible success message in Alfred itself? You can:

1. After the Run Script, add an Output ‚Üí Post Notification
	‚Ä¢	Title: OmniFocus
	‚Ä¢	Text: Triage plugin launched.

or

2. Use Large Type

Right-click ‚Üí Outputs ‚Üí Large Type
	‚Ä¢	Message: Triage plugin launched! üéØ

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Recap: What You Get

Now when you run the Alfred keyword:
	‚Ä¢	OmniFocus launches if it's not running
	‚Ä¢	Your plugin starts automatically
	‚Ä¢	You see a notification that it worked

‚∏ª

Want even more power? I can help you:
	‚Ä¢	üìÜ Schedule this as a recurring background check
	‚Ä¢	üì• Add task summaries to the notification
	‚Ä¢	ü§ù Integrate Alfred with Raycast or Shortcuts

Just let me know how far you want to take it!
