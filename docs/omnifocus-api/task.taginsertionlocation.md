# `Task.TagInsertionLocation`

A location specifying the order of a `Tag` within a `Task`. These cannot be instantiated directly, rather they are returned from properties like `Task.beforeTag()` or `Task.endingOfTags`. (For a complete list of locations, open the navigation sidebar and use its filter to search for `Task.TagInsertionLocation`.)
