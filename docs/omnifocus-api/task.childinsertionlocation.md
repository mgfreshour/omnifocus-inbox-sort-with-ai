# `Task.ChildInsertionLocation`

A location specified relative to an existing `Task` or `Database`. These cannot be instantiated directly, rather they are returned from properties like `Task.before`, `Inbox.ending`, or `Project.beginning`. (For a complete list of locations, open the navigation sidebar and use its filter to search for `Task.ChildInsertionLocation`.)
