# `Tag.TaskInsertionLocation`

A location specifying the order of a `Task` within a `Tag`. These cannot be instantiated directly, rather they are returned from properties like `Tag.beforeTask()` or `Tag.endingOfTasks`. (For a complete list of locations, open the navigation sidebar and use its filter to search for `Tag.TaskInsertionLocation`.)
